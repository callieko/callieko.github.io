**What did you do this past week?**
We finished and turned in the last OOP project. It was definitely one of the easier projects of the year. I also started my final Graphics project, which is fun because I got to choose the project but I'm having trouble finding the motivation to do it. In class we're still talking about abstract classes and class hierarchies.

**What's in your way?**
Motivation. As we near the end of the semester I just cannot muster up the energy to complete my work in a timely manner. If I really had a good attitude about it and the motivation I could probably finish my Graphics project with plenty of time to spare, but I don't. 

**What will you do next week?**
Next week will just be Graphics project and OOP studying all week. I gotta be as prepared as possible for this test. I refuse to get a mediocre grade like I did last time. This test will be rough though because it will cover a LOT more material. I haev to say I'm really worried about what the format of the test will be though because if I've learned anything about this class is that you'll never know what to expect.

**What's my experience of the class?**
I think at this point if my opinion of the class suddenly changed it's because something very bad had happened. Luckily there has not, yet.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
Don't drink cafenated drinks close to bed time, it'll mess up your sleep schedule for weeks. (Can you tell I ran out of tips weeks ago?)
