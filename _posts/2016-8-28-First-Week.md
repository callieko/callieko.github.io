**What did you do this past week?**
We mostly went over the basics and how to set up the environment. I hadn't heard much about the class beforehand so I was surprised by the Socratic method style of teaching. To be honest Professor Downing didn't match the image of him that I had in my mind, but that probably has a lot to do with the fact that on the first day I forgot my schedule and thought I was walking into Algorithms taught by Professor Fraij. 

**What's in your way?**
Definitely my reluctance to say the incorrect answer in class at the risk of sounding stupid. I would rather say "I don't know" than guess and be wrong, which I know is not the correct way to handle the situation but I can't help it. I feel like someone saying "I don't know" isn't as memorable to people as someone saying a ridiculously dumb answer, as I'm known to do. Also I really don't handle being called on very well. One of three things will usually happen: 1.) I was expecting to be called on so I'm crazy nervous, 2.) I'm surprised at being called on so I don't have time to be nervous, 3.) I wasn't paying attention, so not only am I crazy nervous but I don't even know what the question is, but I'll just try to avoid that one.

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I'll try to review the past class material before the quizzes so I'm more prepared. I felt fairly prepared for this week's quiz but that's because not much happened in between the two classes.

**Tip-of-the-Week**
Game Jams and Hack-a-thons are great ways to get practice working in teams and on projects. These projects looks great on a resume and you work with really talented people who you can learn a lot from, plus make new friends!

EGADS is holding a game jam on September 10th! Don't miss it!!
