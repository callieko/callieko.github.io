**What did you do this past week?**
I finally started studying for the OOP test, although I didn't do THAT much, just went through my notes and tried to fill in some holes. I mostly worked on my graphics project, which is coming along quite well, although it's exhausting to work on. My code base seems so growing quicker than I can actually think about what I'm doing. Anyways in class we finally finished talking about classes and we started talking about shared_ptrs and unique_ptrs which was really useful information.

**What's in your way?**
Sleep deprivation.

**What will you do next week?**
I'm hoping to finish my graphics project this weekend so that I can spend all next week focusing on the OOP final. That would be ideal for sure. I've done the calculations on how well I have to do on the test so now I've just got to hit that mark. I'll do my best!!

**What's my experience of the class?**
Good, especially now that I don't have to worry about the quizzes anymore. That was the most nerve-wracking part of the class. Just realized this is the last blog post of the semester. I hope everyone had an enjoyable and worthwhile semester!

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
You don't have to work at a tech company to have a coding job over the Summer. There's TONS of instructor positions for kids coding camps all over the country and they're a really great way to keep you sharp and busy (and maybe earn a bit of cash).
