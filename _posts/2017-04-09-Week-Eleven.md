**What did you do this past week?**
Again, graphics, graphics and more graphics. In class we talked even more about classes and their functions and constructors. Who knew that much could even be said about them, honestly? I thought it was interesting that theres a built-in C++ function that castes objects to r-values. We finished the OOP project (Darwin) just in time. We had problems making it fast enough to pass the last test but we were able to do it.

**What's in your way?**
My graphics project. It's literally taking up 100% of my time and I still don't think I'm going to complete it on time. I hardly have time for all the other projects I have (of which there are quite a few). So yeah I guess that's technially time management but really it's more just "This project is really really hard". (This is the same thing I said last week but it's still true so...)

**What will you do next week?**
Next week we will finally. FINALLY. be done with the graphics project and I'll be able to go back to my life. Also the next OOP project will be released so I'm hoping to get a head start on that. I have a partner and we've already planned when to meet so I'm not too worried about it.

**What's my experience of the class?**
The specifications about the UML for the project were very vague and unclear honestly. If we lose points for not doing it correctly I won't be very happy.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
Go see the movie Your Name. Absolutely great movie. Bawled my eyes out.
