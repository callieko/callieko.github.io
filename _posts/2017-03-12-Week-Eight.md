**What did you do this past week?**
We talked more about C++ classes and constructors. Also surprisingly and out of the blue, Downing cancelled Friday's class for Spring Break, which was great! I was able to finish my Graphics project because of it. I spent every waking moment of this week working on my submission for my Games 4 Health videos. The next project was released but there was an issue with Hacker Rank and the acceptance tests, and as far as I know currently there's an issue with the Github acceptance tests in that they're incorrect.

**What's in your way?**
Right now my stress and anxiety are getting to me just because I recently did an interview and I'm waiting on the results. It's just a constant dull anxiety that I can feel in the pit of my stomach that becomes really irritating after a while. Waiting is absolutely the most excruciating thing for me.

**What will you do next week?**
This next week is Spring Break! I hope to spend most of my time relaxing but I want to spend the first weekend doing all my homework so I don't have to work about it. Other than that I plan on sewing, which is one of my hobbies thaat I hardly ever have time to do.

**What's my experience of the class?**
The class is great. The lectures fly by and are really engaging most of the time. 

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
