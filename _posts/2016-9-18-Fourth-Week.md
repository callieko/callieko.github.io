**What did you do this past week?**
My club's event happened this last week so I was finally able to realx a little bit. It's quickly becoming clear to me that things don't get easier when you become an upperclassman. Not that I thought it did per se but I thought maybe I'd get better at this whole college thing. I didn't. A lot of people have dropped CS371p now. We were given our project 2 instructions and it's even more open ended than the last project. This one we can have partners for though (in fact it's extra credit) so that's nice. I just asked my friend to be my partner.

**What's in your way?**
My schedule and my procrastination. I'm uber busy on top of being really bad at convincing mself to work. Not a good combination. I'm getting better at starting things early though, and I can already tell my motivation skills are improving. I've started forcing myself to do things faster than my brain can find an excuse not to.

**What will you do next week?**
This next we is the career fair (woooo...) which of course I will be attending, as everyone should. I have to double check my resume and things like that. I'm going to try to psych myself but I'm normally REALLY bad at talking to people. Not looking forward to it.

**Tip-of-the-Week**
Be on the first bus to the career fair if possible. Not only are there way less people, but you can have much more initmate conversations with recruiters. This was a great strategy when the fair used to start at 10pm but I'm not sure how well it go now that it starts at 1pm. Regardless the idea is good.
