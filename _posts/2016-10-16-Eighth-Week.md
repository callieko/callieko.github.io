**What did you do this past week?**
The course schedule for next semester was released. Every year I think it will get less stressful and it never does. In fact it get's more stressful because you have less courses to choose from. Anyways we still haven't gotten our test grades back from the exam. We just today got the scores for project 2. This next week project 3 is due I worked on that.

**What's in your way?**
Currently my course schedule is stressing me out. I thought I had things together and then the class I needed was cancelled. Every time I think I've gotten things together something else comes up. Ugh. I'm so completely ready for a break. Any break. Thanksgiving break, I guess.

**What will you do next week?**
Start studying for the algorithms exam, because everytime you think you're done with exams, exams start again. Also working on project 3, which is not too difficult of a project at all. I'm hoping we can get it done pretty quickly. But of course as soon as you think a project is easy that's when it get's you. I also have a test for an internship due this week that's making me nervous. I hope that goes well so there will at least be one thing I don't have to worry about.

**Tip-of-the-Week**
Utilize UHS for any health problems you might have. It's cheap ($5 for an appointment) and they're very helpful and convenient. The only problem with them is that they're only open 9-5 so sometimes that can be an issue. We also have emotional health services beut I've never used them.
