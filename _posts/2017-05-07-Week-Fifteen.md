So to summarize I think I learned a great deal in this class and it's worthwhile to take, especially if you want to learn C++. Having taken it twice, I would say it's improveing every semester and that Downing works really hard to make improvements and take suggestions (I think it's a big reason he has us write these blog posts). It's not really an object oriented programming class like the title suggests, but I didn't really think it would be so my expectations weren't betrayed. I think Downing is an interesting professor and that this class is probably a must for almost all CS students.
