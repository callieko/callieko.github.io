**What did you do this past week?**
I just got back from the EGADS Fall game jam which was fun, exhausting, and educational. I really wish I could go to sleep right now but I have work to do. As far as OOP goes the Collatz project was due on Thursday. I definitely wasn't on top of it like I should've been, and Travis being down for four hours didn't help. I had a LOT of trouble finding relevant information about the project, which seemed to be more or less scattered between Piazza, the project page, and things said verbally in class. More than the location of the information was how specific everything had to be. Everything had to be exactly correct. I'm hoping the next project goes smoother now that we've gotten things more or less set up.

**What's in your way?**
Lately I've been busy with the organization I'm VP for, which is fun, but logistics planning can be really time-consuming. I've also been sleep-deprived lately. So that's great.

**What will you do next week?**
I've got a busy schedule so I'm going to do my best to stay afloat, as always. I'm hoping the week after this will get better, time-wise, but I'm going to have to be on top of it if I want to actually do well my classes.

**Tip-of-the-Week**
I came into this problem a LOT using git at the game jam. Using a gui-based mergetool will save your hours of headache and heartache when using git. Some recommendations:\n
Meld (Win, Ubuntu)\n
WinMerge (Windows)\n
Kaleidoscope (Mac, but not free)\n
As far as Mac goes, it may be a good idea to use SourceTree and use git through that
\n
EXTRA:\n
I considered putting this as my tip-of-the-week but it didn't quite seem formal or academic enough. My dad is an electrical engineer who mostly programs. In fact he mostly programs in C++. And he has a lot of opinions about references, which is why I thought it might be interesting to show because that's our current class topic. Anyways here's a very poor quality video of a skype call I just had with my parents. WARNING: Colorful language.\n

By the way, this is the third time he's gone on this rant since the semester started.
