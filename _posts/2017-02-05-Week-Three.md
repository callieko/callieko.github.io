title:  Week Three

**What did you do this past week?**
We finished up the Collatz project. We also talked about references and exceptions. On Wednesday we had a UT alumnus from Bloomberg talk (a little) about working at Bloomberg and (a lot) about his own project.

**What's in your way?**
My immune system. I got sick this week, sicker than I've ever been in my life. My nails turned blue because I couldn't breath. So I haven't left my apartment in three days except to go to the doctor (who told me not to leave my apartment). Even though I'm well again it's still tough to get around because I've been in bed and lost all my stamina.

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I'll be playing a bit of catchup as I complete work I should've been doing while I was sick but still doing my daily schoolwork.

**What's my experience of the class?**
My experience is pretty normal. The kinks in the workflow for the projects that caused a lot of trouble last semester seem to have been ironed out this semester, which is good.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
If you're sick, for the love of God don't go to class, especially in the beginning of the semester when you still have your absent days. When you go to class you get other people sick, and that's not okay. If you absolutely must go to class, or leave your house at all, use Purell liberally, particularly every time you touch your nose, and wear a face mask (which you can get for FREE at the Student Services building). You might feel that you look weird wearing a mask but considering you're sick you probably don't look great anyways so suck it up, it's not that weird. Please be responsible.

Also don't be afraid to take advantage of UT health services. A regular appointment is only $10.
