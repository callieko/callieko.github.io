**What did you do this past week?**
My sickness continued so I went to UHS where they did some blood tests but they couldn't find anything. So that's great. Feeling better but still have weird symptoms. I had a break today for the first time all semester (that wasn't sickness induced) so I'm feeling good comparatively. Test scores STILL haven't been released, but we got the scores for the first two questions and... Let's just say my future is bleak. Anyways we also had a project due this week. It was tougher than it initially seemed but there were no troubles once you really got down to the details. Grace Hopper was also this week, but I didn't go.

**What's in your way?**
I don't know. Studying? I probably need to devote more time to studying after class and not just before an exam. And I need to force myself to do extra problems and not just the ones that are assigned. I'd do a lot better on tests that way.

**What will you do next week?**
Next week is proabably the slowest week I'll have had all semester so I'm looking forward to it. Maybe I'll get to work on some of my own projects and do some sewing. I plan on sewing tomorrow and I'm really looking forward to it. It's a great creative outlet. Speaking of creative outlets \/

**Tip-of-the-Week**
If you're like me and like to do creative, artsy stuff, AET classes are really fantastic. They're typically project based, but the projects are all creative endeavors. Every AET professor I've had has been fantastic and to be honest if you just do the work you'll usually get an A. Really interesting, fulfilling classes.
