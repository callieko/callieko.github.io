**What did you do this past week?**
We didn't have a project to work on because we have a test this next week, which was good because I was pretty swamped with projects for other classes.

**What's in your way?**


**What will you do next week?**


**What's my experience of the class?**


**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
