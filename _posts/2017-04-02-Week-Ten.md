**What did you do this past week?**
We were given our next project to do, which is called Darwin. I spent a loooot of time on my graphics project. All of it actually. In class we continued to talk about classes and constructors and putting all our knowledge about them together.

**What's in your way?**
My graphics project. It's literally taking up 100% of my time and I still don't think I'm going to complete it on time. I hardly hardly have time for all the other projects I have (of which there are quite a few). 

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I'll still be juggling my graphics project and the OOP project.

**What's my experience of the class?**
I'm really not doing well on the quizzes, except for the one we had this week about the project. It feels like all of the quizzes are trick questions and under the time constraints I find myself guessing the answer rather than actually trying to figure what's beign asked.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
