**What did you do this past week?**
We took our midterm for the class. I felt fairly sure of myself while I was taking it but after talking to my friends and seeing how they thought they messed up I don't know. I don't even want to think about it until I get my grade back. The really stressful thing is if I did moderately poorly on it I'll have to drop the class, so if this is the last post from me now you know why!

**What's in your way?**
I just really didn't study enough for this exam. I felt so burnt out after last week that I spent a lot of time relaxing, which to be honest I don't regret doing. I wasn't in good shape mentally or physically. The best way to study for the exam wwould have been to do the kind of coding questions he tells you to do in class, which I didn't really end up doing even though I knew I should've. Just rough.

**What will you do next week?**
Drop the class maybe? I don't know we'll see I guess. I hope we get our grades back quickly so I can know. Other than that just the same stuff I always do. I think I'll try to hang out with my friends a bit more maybe.

**Tip-of-the-Week**
Tips for avoiding sickness: Emergen-C actually works, take it (preferably with orange juice) if you see a lot of people getting sick. People always get sick during and after midterm time, and immediately following changes of season. Use hand sanitizer to prevent sickness, and if you do get sick, for the love of God use sanitizer frequently so you don't get other people sick. Most people don't do that and it drives me insane.
