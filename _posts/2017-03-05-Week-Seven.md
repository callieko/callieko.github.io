**What did you do this past week?**
This past week we had our test. To my shock and surprise it was totally a multiple choice test. Even more shockingly we got our scores back immediately after pressing submit. I think that weighting of the questions was absolutely ridiculous. There's no reason a single question should be worth 25 points. I would've FAAAAR preferred there were way more questions (at LEAST double the number) so that you don't miss a single question and get a B. That's silly to me. Besides that it was Explore UT and raining yesterday so I'm happy about that.

**What's in your way?**
Things are going fairly well actually. I just need to push myself a little more to get things done when I she be doing them. But I'm on top of everything right now.

**What will you do next week?**
I have an interview and we should be getting project 3 so I plan to work on it as soon as possible. Personally I'm glad we get the project before Spring Break because I have absolutely nothing but time. We also have a Graphics project due next week but we're already ahead on it so I'm feeling good. I also have a big contest entry due so I'm spending all my freetime with that. Even thinking about it now makes me really nervous I'm not sure if I'll get it done....

**What's my experience of the class?**
Pretty bummed about my test grade. But so it goes!

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
If you wanna make a game really quick Stencyl is good, but it basically has the processing power of potato. Great for platformers and flash games.
