**What did you do this past week?**
This past week I feel like I got a better idea of what the class is like. A lot of class time is spent talking about the project and the C++ learning naturally comes along with it. I like that style. It's also the kind of class where it's better to just sit and pay attention rather than take notes, especially because everything written gets uploaded. That said, I do wish that I did take a few notes on things that are said but not uploaded later, because sometimes remembering specific details is an issue.

**What's in your way?**
I'm awful at time management. I always over commit or procrastinate or both. Right now I'm over commiting. I think that for me over commiting is somehow better because I feel like I ge more done and I feel more fulfilled, but my health (and sometimes my grades) always take a major hit. My primary goal for this year is to learn where my balance is and to somehow overcome my atrocious procrastination.

**What will you do next week?**
For this next week I'm trying to get a lot of my work done in advance because I know it will be a busy week. The first project is due this week and I haven't done much in that regard so I think that will be my biggest hurdle.

**Tip-of-the-Week**
Fill out your entire LinkedIn profile and keep it update, including a summary of yourself. Also be sure to include summaries for all of your jobs that include points about how you helped the company or what you contributed
