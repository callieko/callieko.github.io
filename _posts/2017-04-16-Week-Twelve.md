**What did you do this past week?**
Finally finished the graphics project that has bee plaguing me. It feels good to be done with that. We got our grade back for Darwin already. Also the Life project was released and we started working on that. It's a surprisingly easy project, actually.

**What's in your way?**
Just keeping the motivation to get all my work done promptly. Hopfully this will be the first week where I'll actually have some free time (especially because I've had Persona 5 and Breath of the Wild sitting on my coffee table for a week now...)

**What will you do next week?**
I hope to finish the Life project by Monday, so the plan is use next week for my final Graphics project and studying for the OOP final. I know it's a little bit early to be studying for a final but it's really the only final I have and I REALLY want to get a good grade on it.

**What's my experience of the class?**
I appreciate that the grading has been really fast, probably because of the inclusion of Hackerrank. It's a pretty good system in my opinion because we know EXACTLY how our code will do on the tests because we run the tests ourselves. I also really appreciate Eric's exhaustive tests that he's been putting out. They're INCREDIBLY helpful for finding exactly where the bugs are in our code.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
I always thought I could get by with not practicing interview questions. Turns out I can't! Find some friends and make it an event! They can be harder than you think!
