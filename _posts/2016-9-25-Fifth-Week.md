**What did you do this past week?**
We worked on the Netflix project, in which you made an algorithm which parsed a bunch of data and came up with Netflix rating predictions for certain customers. The problem itself was interesting and fun but it was really hard to feel that way with how difficult it was to figure out all the requirements for the project. There was also an issue with travis being queued for the whole class which really slowed things down. I worked with a partner for this project, which I found invaluable because you're going to be asking other classmates a ton of questions anyways as far project specifications go. We also had a GREAT speaker from JPL come in who talked both about the project he's working on (which was super cool), but also gave us some practical tips about project design and time management. I thought it was a great talk.

**What's in your way?**
I've realized recently that in my pursuit to say "no" to procrastination/laziness, I've become burdened with all the things I've said yes to. Anyways I need to find more time to destress meaningfully, like not just watching netflix (lol), because that's not time-efficient. Also, and this is only annoying m right now but, there are WAY too many pinned posts on the piazza page. It kind of defeats the purpose of pinning a post.

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I'll be finding a partner for the next project and starting on it as soon as it comes out. I don't actually know when it comes out (if it's written somewhere on the class site, I certainly can't find it) but when it does that's what I'll be doing. I'm tired of turning in projects 15 minutes before they're due. I'll also be going to a TA session to ask about my project 1 grade.

**Tip-of-the-Week**
Make the links to projects on your resume clickable if you're applying online. Particularly if they're games or some web-based application. Also having your own website is a great idea both in general and to host your projects on.
