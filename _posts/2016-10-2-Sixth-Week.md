**What did you do this past week?**
It was midterm week so everyone was super busy. Of course next week is midterm week too so... Still super busy. We had our Algorithms midterm so everyone was stressing about that. It didn't end up being as hard as we all thought it was but I definitely didn't get 100% or anything. The most stressful thing was the projects I had from other classes that were also due last week. I don't think many people got a lot of sleep. Also I got sick. Because the start of Fall coincided perfectly with midterms I think a lot of people got sick. In OOP we learned about a lot of weird tricks and rules that really only apply to C++ and things got weird. 

**What's in your way?**
I feel like I don't have any time to do my hobbies anymore and its bumming me out... Might need to do some time rearranging. 

**What will you do next week?**
OOP exam next week! Study study study! I wish we had a practice exam so we knew vaguely what the test would look like. We get one page of notes, which is a godsend because there are so many minute details that I absolutely would not be able to rememeber. We aren't allowed to have code on it though, I fine with that, it makes sense, considering the test is coding.

**Tip-of-the-Week**
The CS department and clubs hold events all the time that are usually meant to be networking events but almost always feature talks by indutry professionals about very practical skills. You can learn a lot from them! You can find these events on the CS events emails that are sent every week.
